This repository contains the R code for running the shinyMobile application. 

Running this code requires some installation of other services, but it can serve as a template for those who wish to create a similar app. For instance, I have included the Dockerfile for those who wish to see how it can be connected to Google Cloud Run (or a similar cloud-based service). 

Here's a list of all files/folders and what they do:

global.R contains global variables that are automatically passed to both server.R and ui.R - these three files form the backbone of the Shiny application.
Simply run either server, ui, or global.R files to get the whole thing running. 

Analytics - contains code for creating graphs within the app.
Code preparation - contains some general helper functions.
Database manipulation - contains code for interacting with PostgreSQL database. In my case, I used ElephantSQL - an online PostgreSQL server. 
Javascript - contains JS code.
Server - for Shiny server functions.
UI - contains Shiny UI code. 
www - contains PWA service worker code for PWA functionality.
