This repository contains the R code for running the shinyMobile application. 

It will not be possible to run this code without modification, but it can serve as a template for those who wish to create a similar app. Hence, I have included the Dockerfile for those who wish to see how it can be connected to Google Cloud Run (or a similar cloud-based service). 

Here's a list of all files/folders and what they do:

global.R contains global variables that are automatically passed to both server.R and ui.R.
Simply run either server, ui, or global.R files to get the whole thing running. 

Analytics - contains graph files.
Code preparation - contains helper functions.
Database manipulation - contains code for interacting with postgres.
Javascript - contains JS.
rsconnect - for shinyapps.io.
Server - for server functions.
Tests - for unit testing etc.
UI - contains UI code. 
www - contains pwa service worker code for pwa functionality.
